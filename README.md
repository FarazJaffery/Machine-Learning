#  **Machine Learning: Lung Diseases Classification Research Project**
## **Project Title:**

### *An Automated System for the Classification of Bronchiolitis and Bronchiectasis Diseases using Lung Sound Analysis*

## **Purpose of the Project:**
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine-learning project aimed at classifying lung diseases using audio signal analysis. The project focuses on developing a classification model to identify bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis from lung sounds.

## **Methodology:**
The methodology involves preprocessing lung sound signals using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to remove noise and then extracting Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature representation. The Fine K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is employed with ten-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness against random factors.

## **Setup and Running the Code:**
### **To run the code, follow these steps:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository folder.
3. Load the trained model using the command: load('myTrainedModel.mat');
4. To make predictions with new data, ensure it matches the training dataâ€™s features
5. Use this command for predictions: newPredictions = trainedModel.predictFcn(newData);

## **Dependencies:**
1. MATLAB (R2021a or above)

2. Classification Learner Toolbox
