 -->  To use the trained model, load it in MATLAB with the following command:

 -->  load('myTrainedModel.mat');


 -->  Assuming 'newData' is a matrix with the same features as the training data
 -->  Replace 'newData' with your actual new data variable in the following command
 -->  Make predictions using the loaded model

 -->  newPredictions = trainedModel.predictFcn(newData);
